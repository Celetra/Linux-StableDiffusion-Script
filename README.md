# Linux Stable Diffusion Script
A simple script to automate the installation and running of the hlky Stable Diffusion fork for Linux users. 

Please see my guide for running this on Linux: https://rentry.org/linux-sd

**PLEASE NOTE: In order to upgrade to version 1.7 or later of this script, you must delete your pre-existing `ultimate-stable-diffusion` folder and do a clean re-install using the script. You can copy your `outputs` folder in there to save it elsewhere and then add it back once the re-install is done. Also, make sure your original 1.4 models are saved somewhere, or else you will need to re-download them from Hugging Face. They can be found in `ultimate-stable-diffusion/models/ldm/stablediffusion-v1/Model.ckpt` if you do not have them saved elsewhere.**
