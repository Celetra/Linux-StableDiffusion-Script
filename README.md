# Linux Stable Diffusion Script
A simple script to automate the installation and running of the hlky Stable Diffusion fork for Linux users. 

Please see my guide for running this on Linux: https://rentry.org/linux-sd

TO-DO:

- [x] Add ability to update Stable DIffusion without having to manually delete the core folder.
- Possibly add a way to setup the base Optimized Stable Diffusion for those that truly need the lower VRAM limits.
